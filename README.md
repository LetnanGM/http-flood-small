### Hello Everyone!

hello everyone, I am a beginner python programmer.

I first created a repository on GitHub, I am currently creating a pentest script to flood http to the target host with IP or URL.

I am not responsible for what you do, I only recommend using this script as a pentest or testing your website, don't attack other people's websites for no reason, and I am not responsible for what you do and I made this for educational purposes
.
good luck!!

### how to use?
First of all you have to clone my repository using git
```text
git clone https://github.com/LetnanGM/http-flood-small.git
```

and next, enter the folder using the cd (change directory) command
```text
cd http-flood-small
```

after that, just run it, using python command
```text
python main.py
```
